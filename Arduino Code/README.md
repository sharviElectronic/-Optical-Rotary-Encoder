<p>Shielding is important. At a minimum, the cable should be protected either by a foil jacket with a drain wire or by a braided-wire shield that is grounded. For very sensitive applications or high-EMI environments, foil jacketed wires in combination with an overall braided-wire shield around the cable should be used to avoid interference and precise encoder output. </p>
